The models have two prime benefits: 1) Since many factors have similar tagrget sequences we often experience multiple predictions at the same locations that correspond to the same site. This type of models reduce the complexity of the results. 2) The models can be used to classify newly derived profiles (or project what type of structural class its cognate transcription factor belongs to). <br><b>When should it be used?</b> When searching large genomic sequences with no prior knowledge.

The <a href="http://autosome.ru/ChIPMunk">ChIPMunk</a> software was used to construct positional weight matrices. Four motif discovery strategies were tested based on different motif shape priors including flat and periodic priors associated with DNA helix pitch. A quality rating was manually assigned to each model based on known binding preferences. An appropriate TFBS model was selected for each TF&#44; with similar models selected for related TFs. In any case only one model per TF was selected unless there was additional evidence for two distinct binding models or different stable modes of dimerization. All TFBS models and initial binding segments data used for motif discovery were mapped to UniPROT IDs.
